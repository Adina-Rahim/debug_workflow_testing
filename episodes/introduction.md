## Outline
* You are going to be part of a [Scrum Team](../learners/reference.md#scrum-team) for the next 2 days working on a micro-project.
* The departmental process makes use of several [Scrum](../learners/reference.md#scrum) roles as defined in [the Agile Methods for RSEs Handbook](../learners/handbook.md#roles). On this course, you will assume the following roles based on the duties you are expected to perform at your grade:
    * **G7s**: At least 1 sprint as [Scrum Master](../learners/reference.md#scrum-master). Potentially switching to a [Developer](../learners/reference.md#developer) role for a day if there are more than one G7 in your team. As a [Scrum Master](../learners/reference.md#scrum-master) in this course, your expected responsibilities are outlined [here](../profiles/learner-profiles.md#scrum-master).
    * **G4/G5/G6**: All sprints as [Developer](../learners/reference.md#developer). You can find the expected responsibilities for the Developer role [here](../profiles/learner-profiles.md#developer).
Where this course varies to a real department project, is that we also have people acting a **[Facilitator](../profiles/learner-profiles.md#facilitator)**. This is not a [Scrum](../learners/reference.md#scrum) role but for the purposes of this course, will assume the role of [Product Owner](../learners/reference.md#product-owner), representing a research team (i.e., [Stakeholders](../learners/reference.md#stakeholder)) who are only "lightly engaged" with the process, and will help you clarify requirements as needed. There will be an opportunity for you to act as a [Product Owner](../learners/reference.md#product-owner) yourself during some of the challenges, as this is something you will likely need to do in reality from time to time.

## Scrum Development Cycle Overview
As we explained in the course [Pre-Reading](../learners/setup.md#pre-reading) slides, [Scrum](../learners/reference.md#scrum) encourages the mindset where change is the norm and allows the software development process to embrace that change.
The Scrum methodology fulfils this philosophy by using Sprint Cycles. Each [Iteration](../learners/reference.md#iteration) (sprint) last 2-4 weeks, and gives the [Stakeholders](../learners/reference.md#stakeholder) and [Product Owner](../learners/reference.md#product-owner) a chance to update priorities for the following sprint.

## Scrum Roles
The following slide, from the [Pre-Reading](../learners/setup.md#pre-reading) material, shows the key [Scrum Roles](../learners/reference.md#scrum-roles), but we typically loosen the definition of [Scrum Roles](../learners/reference.md#scrum-roles) in our RSE version of [Scrum](../learners/reference.md#scrum). For example, our G7 [Scrum Masters](../learners/reference.md#scrum-master) would assume a level of responsibility for delivery that would normally be held by the [Product Owner](../learners/reference.md#product-owner). Also, the [Product Owner](../learners/reference.md#product-owner) role might be done by the [Scrum Master](../learners/reference.md#scrum-master), [Developer](../learners/reference.md#developer)(s) and/or members of the academic team, depending upon the project size and level of engagement by the academics.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- You will be working on a [Scrum Team](../learners/reference.md#scrum-team) of [Developers](../learners/reference.md#developer) over 2 days.
- All RSEs will fulfil the [Developer](../profiles/learner-profiles.md#developer) role at some point.
- Grade 7 RSEs will fulfil the [Scrum Master](../profiles/learner-profiles.md#scrum-master) role at some point.
- The [Facilitator](../profiles/learner-profiles.md#facilitator) is a role specific to the training course and will assume the [Product Owner](../profiles/learner-profiles.md#acting-as-product-owner) role throughout the workshop, although you will have the oppotunity to temporarily act as a PO through specific challenges.
